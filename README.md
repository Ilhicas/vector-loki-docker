# Usage

This repository contains a docker-compose file that can be used to run a local example of vector with file input and output for the loki sink.

This is a companion repository where its usage is explained in my [blog](https://ilhicas.com/2023-01-29-Using-vector-to-centralize-logs-in-loki.html)
